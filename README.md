# Calculator-Project-

Two Type of Calcultor in this Project one is console based and second is Digital with advanced feature calculator.

Digital calculator with advanced features in Python, I need to provide a fully functional program that has a user interface and supports basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced features like trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentiation, etc.

Considering the request, I will create a standalone Python script that implements a GUI calculator with advanced functionality using the Tkinter library because it's standard in Python and easy to use.
